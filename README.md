# Monte-Carlo-Option-Pricing
Monte Carlo simulation for pricing and hedging of European Call Option

The primary objective of the project was to develop a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation model for pricing European options, which is a fundamental tool in financial engineering and risk management. 
This model was utilized to estimate option prices, as well as Greeks (delta and gamma) and implied volatility. 
The analysis of the Monte Carlo estimation involved generating histograms, box plots, QQ plots, etc. 
Additionally, the Black-Scholes (BS) model was employed to provide closed-form solutions for comparison with the Monte Carlo results.\\
The step-by-step process is outlined in the notebook file "main.ipynb," while detailed analysis is presented in the "report.pdf" file.
